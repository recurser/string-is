While there are many great open source projects that would make string conversion easier to implement, a project like this has the potential to devolve into [dependency hell](https://xkcd.com/1987/) unless a conscious effort is made to minimize dependencies. In the interests of simplifying dependencies and minimizing risk, I've taken inspiration (and in many cases actual code) from the following open source projects, rather than include the packages themselves:

* HTML code detection was inspired by (and contains code from) [is-html](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-html) and [html-tags](https://github.com/sindresorhus/html-tags) by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/). These libraries are both released under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
